**2.** **Generative AI using LangChain**





**What is LangChain ?**

* LangChain is an open source framework that helps in building LLM based applications. It provides modular components and end-to-end tools that helps developers build complex AI applications, such as chatbots, question-answering systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), autonomous agents, and more.



* Supports all the major LLMs
* Simplifiers developing LLM based applications (chains, pipelines)
* Integrations available for all major tools
* Open source/Free/Actively developed
* Supports all major GenAI use cases
